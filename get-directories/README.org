* Problem

  *Get Directories*

  You are given a list of strings which represent absolute paths. Identify all unique directories.

  Similar to linux notation, a name which has a slash to the right of it is a directory:

  - =/foo/bar/= both foo and bar are directories
  - =/foo/bar= here foo is a directory but bar is not

  You can assume all paths will be absolute and therefore start with a =/=

  *Example:*

  Input:
  #+begin_src js :eval no
    "/a/b/c/"
    "/a/d"
    "/b/c/"
    "/a/b/d"
    "/a"
    "/d"
    "/a/b/c/e"
  #+end_src

  Output (in no particular order):
  
  #+begin_src js :eval no
    "/"
    "/a"
    "/a/b"
    "/a/b/c/"
    "/b"
    "/b/c/"
  #+end_src
