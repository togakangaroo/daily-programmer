** Problem Statement
    
 #+begin_quote
 On a 2x3 board, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5, and an empty square represented by 0.
 A move consists of choosing 0 and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.
 The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is ~[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]~.
 Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.

 Note:
 - board will be a 2 x 3 array as described above
 - ~board[i][j]~ will be a permutation of ~[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]~
 #+end_quote

 #+NAME: board-1
 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 | 4 | 0 | 5 |

 Expected Output: 1
 Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.

 #+NAME: board-2
 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 | 5 | 4 | 0 |

 Output: -1
 Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.

 #+NAME: board-3
 | 4 | 1 | 2 |
 | 5 | 0 | 3 |

 Expected Output: 5
 Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
 An example path:
 - After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
 - After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
 - After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
 - After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
 - After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
 - After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]

 #+NAME: board-4
 | 3 | 2 | 4 |
 | 1 | 5 | 0 |

 Expected Output: 14
 
** Glossary

We're going to be using the following terms here

- *state* - a 2D state of the board at a given point in time. Since we're moving things around, solving this puzzle can be considered a sequence of states.
- *location* - a two value tuple representing a location in a *state* ~(row, column)~. Might nto be a valid location
- *value* - the actual value in a state at a location

** Thinking it Through

Ok, so lets start here by defining the high level thing we want as if our helper methods allready existed. There is an obvious case for recursion here as I'm picturing execution as a tree (the diagram below is a partial illustration of ~sp-board-3~)

#+begin_src plantuml :file recusive-justification.png :exports results
  @startuml
  hide empty description
  [*] --> 412_503

  412_503 --> 412_053
  412_503 --> 402_513
  412_503 --> 412_530

  412_053 --> 012_453
  412_053 --> 412_503

  402_513 --> 042_513
  402_513 --> 420_513
  402_513 --> 412_503

  412_530 --> 412_503
  412_530 --> 410_532

  012_453 --> 102_453
  012_453 --> 412_053

  102_453 --> 012_453
  102_453 --> 120_453
  102_453 --> 152_403

  120_453 --> 102_453
  120_453 --> 123_450
  123_450 --> [*]

  042_513 --> 402_513
  042_513 --> 542_013

  542_013 --> 042_513
  542_013 --> 542_103

  123_450 : 0
  120_453 : 1

The rules for the recursion therefore seem to be

- A list of known states is a map from a state to the minimum moves from that state. It is seeded with the desired state and a step count of 0
- Given a new state, if we have seen it before, return the number of moves associated
- Otherwise, for each possible move recurse, take the minimum  non-null and add 1. That is the thic cell's value and you return it

An optimization is possible here. If we do the search depth first then once we know the amount of moves one branch takes, we could pass a "moves left" field down to other branches (decremented by 1 on each pass).

So I'm thinking something like this at the high level

#+begin_src python :results none :eval none
  def _get_solve_depth(known_states, state, move_left):
      if state in known_states:
          if None != (steps := known_states.get(state)):
              yield (steps, state)
              return
          return
      if move_left == 0:
          return
      for (next_steps, next_state) in get_states_by_moving_0(state, move_left-1):
          yield (1+next_steps, next_state)



  def get_solve_depth(known_states, state, moves_left):
      known_states = {((1,2,3),(4,5,0)): 0}
      return _get_solve_depth(known_states, ((1,3,0),(4,2,5)), None)
#+end_src

Hmm, that's not right, when would ~known_states~ get mutated?

And I worry about some of the paths being really deep...the worst case scenario here for larger boards could really suck since you'd be effectively exploring the entire space before hitting a solution. If there's no solution it's what...something like ~O(n!)~? Maybe not quite that bad but its bad.

Ok, but looking at that diagram, it's not *that* grim. So what if we go *breadth first* That would look something like this?

#+name: find_min_move
#+begin_src python :results none :session sp 
  from itertools import chain

  _end_state = ((1,2,3), (4,5,0))
  def find_min_move(states, desired_state=_end_state, known_states=set()):
      if desired_state in states:
          return 0
      novel_states = set(states) - known_states
      if not novel_states:
          return None
      known_states = known_states | novel_states #https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58583158/why-does-seem-to-mutate-a-set-when-the-long-form-does-not

      next_states = list(chain(*(get_navigable_states(s, from_value=0) for s in novel_states)))
      next_count = find_min_move(next_states, desired_state, known_states)
      return None if next_count is None else next_count + 1
#+end_src

ok, i think that's good? we do have to implement ~get_navigable_states~ though. easy enough

#+name: get_navigable_states
#+begin_src python :session sp :results none
  def get_navigable_states(state, from_value):
      for (r, row) in enumerate(state):
          for (c, cell) in enumerate(row):
              if cell == from_value:
                  for l in ((r,c+1),
                            (r+1,c),
                            (r,c-1),
                            (r-1,c)):
                      if value_at_location(state, l, default=None) is not None:
                          yield swap(state, (r,c), l)
                  return

#+end_src

looks like we need some helper functions here. 

** Utilities
*** ~value_at_location~ 

Given a 2D state, get the value at the given location - if that location doesn't exist return kw ~default~ or throw if one not provided

#+name: value_at_location
#+begin_src python :session sp :results none
  def _get_value_at_index(coll, idx):
      if not (0 <= idx < len(coll)):
          raise IndexError(f"Invalid index {idx}")
      return coll[idx]

  def value_at_location(state, loc, **kwargs):
      try:
          return _get_value_at_index( _get_value_at_index(state, loc[0]), loc[1])
      except IndexError:
          if "default" in kwargs:
              return kwargs["default"]
          raise
#+end_src

Sample: 

#+name: test-data:value_at_location
#+begin_src python :eval no :exports none
  [
    ((0,1), 2), 
    ((0,3), None), 
    ((-1,1), None),
  ]
#+end_src
#+begin_src python :session sp 
    state = ((1,2,3),
             (4,5,0))
    for (loc, expected) in (
      <<test-data:value_at_location>>
    ):
          
      print(f"value_at_location(state, {loc}) = {value_at_location(state, loc, default=None)}, expected = {expected}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: value_at_location(state, (0, 1)) = 2, expected = 2
: value_at_location(state, (0, 3)) = None, expected = None
: value_at_location(state, (-1, 1)) = None, expected = None

*** ~swap~ - 

Given a 2d state, create a new one with the value at the ~from_~ location swapped with the one at the ~to~

#+name: swap
#+begin_src python :session sp :results none
  from copy import deepcopy
  def swap(state, from_, to_):
      t = value_at_location(state, to_)
      s = list(deepcopy(state))
      s[to_[0]] = list(s[to_[0]])
      s[from_[0]] = list(s[from_[0]])
      s[to_[0]][to_[1]] = value_at_location(state, from_)
      s[from_[0]][from_[1]] = t
      s[to_[0]] = tuple(s[to_[0]])
      s[from_[0]] = tuple(s[from_[0]])
      return tuple(s)
#+end_src

Sample usage:

#+name: test-data:swap
#+begin_src python :eval no :exports none
  [
    ((1,2), (0,2), ((1,2,0),(4,5,3)) ), 
    ((1,2), (1,1), ((1,2,3),(4,0,5)) ), 
  ]
#+end_src

#+begin_src python :session sp
  prompt = "expected: "
  for (from_, to_, expected) in (
      <<test-data:swap>>
  ):
      print(f"swap(state, {from_}, {to_}) = \n{' '*len(prompt)}{swap(state, from_, to_)}\n{prompt}{expected}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: swap(state, (1, 2), (0, 2)) = 
:           ((1, 2, 0), (4, 5, 3))
: expected: ((1, 2, 0), (4, 5, 3))
: swap(state, (1, 2), (1, 1)) = 
:           ((1, 2, 3), (4, 0, 5))
: expected: ((1, 2, 3), (4, 0, 5))


** Putting it Together
     
Ok, so lets test ~get_navigable_states~ to make sure it works
     
#+begin_src python :session sp
  print(f"state is {state}")
  print(f"navigable states from 0 {list(get_navigable_states(state, from_value=0))}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: state is ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 0))
: navigable states from 0 [((1, 2, 3), (4, 0, 5)), ((1, 2, 0), (4, 5, 3))]


This looks good...so if I got it right then this should just work

#+name: boards-to-test
#+begin_src python :var board1=board-1 :var board2=board-2 :var board3=board-3 :var board4=board-4 :exports none
  def tupelize_iterable(coll):
      """
      In order to be hashable with set(), we expect input to find_min_move to be tuples but
      org returns tables as lists, so this helper function is helpful to tuple-ize all
      iterables recursively
      """
      if not hasattr(coll, "__iter__"):
          return coll
      return tuple((tupelize_iterable(x) for x in coll))

  print([
      (tupelize_iterable(b), expected)
      for b, expected in (
              (board1, 1),
              (board2, None),
              (board3, 5),
              (board4, 14)
      )
  ])
#+end_src

#+begin_src python :session sp

  for (board, expected) in (

      board = tupelize_iterable(board)
      print(f"for {board} min move: {find_min_move((board,))}, expected: {expected}")
      print(f"====================")
