[[https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-english-words/description/][This is a leetcode problem]]. I recently got laid off and I should practice
* Problem Statement
#+begin_quote
Convert a non-negative integer num to its English words representation.
#+end_quote
#+begin_src python :eval no
  0 <= num <= 2**31 - 1
#+end_src
** Example 1

Input: num = 123
Output: "One Hundred Twenty Three"
** Example 2

Input: num = 12345
Output: "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"

** Example 3

Input: num = 1234567
Output: "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"

* Brainstorming
Let's see if we can just say the rules in english and I'll try to avoid saying that the right answer is just to throw it at ChatGPT.

I'm thinking about examining the number form the back forward

- If lterally 0 then say zero
- For the ones
  - if 1-9 then say the digit
  - if 0 then say nothing
- For the tens
  - if 4, 6-9 then its the digit+ty
  - if 5, then fifty
  - if 3, then thirty
  - if 2, then twenty
  - if 0, then nothing
  - if 1, then
    - do not run the ones
    - if ones place is
      - 0 then ten
      - 1 then eleven
      - 2 then twelve
      - 3 then thirteen
      - 5 then fifteen
      - 4, 6-9 then digit+teen
- For hundres
  - digit+hundred
- For thousands
  - digit+thousand
- Tens thousands
  - same rules as tens+thousand
- Hundred thousands
  - same rules as hundreds+thousand
- Millions
  - same as ones+million

I'm not the most clear on the more advanced numbers but I feel like if I get 0-9999 right then the rest will fall into place

* Implementation

You know, I've seen ruby pop up several times in JDs I've looked at and...I'm not a ruby guy, so like, lets do it in ruby

#+begin_src ruby :var num=9112
  1+num
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 9113
