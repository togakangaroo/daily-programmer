#+TITLE: Island Perimeter
* Problem Statement
  [[https://operation-code.slack.com/archives/C7JMZ5LAV/p1633353389035400][From OpCode Slack]]

  You are given =row x col= grid representing a map where ~grid[i][j] = 1~ represents land and ~grid[i][j] = 0~ represents water.

  Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

  The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

  *Constraints:*
  - ~row == grid.length~
  - ~col == grid[i].length~
  - ~1 <= row, col <= 100~
  - ~grid[i][j] is 0 or 1~
  - There is exactly one island in grid.

** Example 1:
   - Input :: ~grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]~
   - Output :: ~16~
   - Explanation :: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes

       |   | X |   |   |
       | X | X |   |   |
     #+end_src

** Example 2:
   - Input :: ~grid = [[1]]~
   - Output :: ~4~


** Example 3:
   - Input :: grid = ~[[1,0]]~
   - Output :: ~4~

  So normally I would start jotting down ideas here but in this case I used the time-honored strategy of taking a shower and of course it came to me.

** Node Map
   For our purposes, lets count coordinates at the vertices, not at the cells! So in [[Example 1]] above we take =0 0= at the upper left vertex, going accross to =4 0= and down to =4 4= we then express the chart as a list of connections from each vertex

   #+name: racket/example-1/node-map
   #+begin_src racket :export code :eval no
     (apply hash '((1 0) ((2 0) (1 1))
                         (2 0) ((2 1) (1 0))
                         (0 1) ((1 1) (0 2))
                         (1 1) ((2 1) (1 2) (0 1) (1 0))
                         (2 1) ((3 1) (2 2) (1 1) (2 0))
                         (3 1) ((3 2) (2 1))
                         (0 2) ((2 1) (0 1))
                         (1 2) ((2 2) (1 3) (0 2) (1 1))
                         (2 2) ((3 2) (2 3) (1 2) (2 1))
                         (3 2) ((2 2) (3 1))
                         (0 3) ((1 3) (0 4))
                         (1 3) ((2 3) (1 4) (0 3) (1 2))
                         (2 3) ((2 4) (1 3) (2 2))
                         (0 4) ((1 4) (0 3))
                         (1 4) ((2 4) (0 4) (1 3))
                         (2 4) ((1 4) (2 3))))
   #+end_src

   But that;s not quite right, After all, I need an indicator *which* connection to ove to, not all steps are along the outside of the shape.

   So uhh...can we filter out the ones that are internal? Probably best to not place them in the list to begin with, but the logic should apply either way. What makes a connection internal? For [[Example 1]] we would want to omit the connection between =1 1= and =2 1=. Why? Because the square to either side of that connection is full.

   To do this...it actually *does* seem like it would be easier if we also had a full mapping of the board itself so we could refer to full cells. 
   - A connection between =x1 y1

   Given a proper node map structure like above, it should be trivial to determine perimeter. You literally start anywhere and try to move into the first connection that you have not yet visited until you can do it no more. Each time you step you increase a counter
  
   This only works come to think of it,  if there are no *internal* nodes tracked.

   None of the examples above describe one, we Need to

   Let's not worry about that now, lets assume it already has been properly arranged where all data in it is relevant. If that is the case, then you can pick any point on the ,,

** Parser

   Ok you know what, I think all the stuff I'm doing above is good, but it certainly is making assumptions about what sort of data structure is easy to parse that I am not certain would hold. Let's figure that side of it out right now

   First, can I write a brag grammar for what the board looks like? It kinda seems straightforward, lets try it
   
   #+name: ip.parser.rkt
   #+begin_src racket :eval no
     #lang brag
     ip-program : "\n"* ip-row ("\n"+ ip-row)*
     ip-row : ip-whitespace* ip-cell* ip-vertical-wall ip-whitespace*
     ip-cell : ip-vertical-wall ip-whitespace+ ip-mark ip-whitespace+
     ip-whitespace : " "
     ip-vertical-wall : "|"
     ip-land : "X"
     ip-water : " "
     ip-mark : ip-land | ip-water
   #+end_src

   Uhh...I'm actually pretty confident about that one, let's try it out on [[Example 1]]

   #+begin_src racket :eval yes :adjacent-file ip.parser.rkt
     #lang br
     (require "ip.parser.rkt")
     (parse-to-datum "
       <<example=1/diagram>>")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : '(ip-program "\n" (ip-row (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-water " ")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-land "X")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-water " ")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-water " ")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-vertical-wall "|")) "\n" (ip-row (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-land "X")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-land "X")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-land "X")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-water " ")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-vertical-wall "|")) "\n" (ip-row (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-water " ")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-land "X")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-water " ")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-water " ")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-vertical-wall "|")) "\n" (ip-row (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-land "X")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-land "X")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-water " ")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-cell (ip-vertical-wall "|") (ip-whitespace " ") (ip-mark (ip-water " ")) (ip-whitespace " ")) (ip-vertical-wall "|")))
    
   Oh nice! With a minimal amount of twiddling, that actually worked.

   So the next bit is going to be simply modifying the bf example from the Beautiful Racket book. In that example they use a tokenizer to ignore the comments. In this case I don't think we need that. I suspect we could get rid of the tokenizer entirely and just use the default but because I don't know how off the top of my head, lets just make a tokenizer that simply makes every character into a token

   First thought is to get only the edges which I can do by a laplace filter using a convolution matrix of

   |    0 | -.25 |    0 |
   | -.25 |    1 | -.25 |
   |    0 | -.25 |    0 |
    
   but....what does that actually do for me? Lets create an example with some internals

   #+name: example-4/diagram
   #+begin_src racket :eval no
     |   |   | X |   |   |
     | X | X | X | X |   |
     | X | X | X | X |   |
     | X | X | X | X |   |
     |   |   | X |   |   |
     | X | X | X |   |   |
   #+end_src

   In this case, cells =(2 1) (1 2) (2 2) (2 3)= are completely internal and do not need to be considered.

   Lets say I'm tracking around the edges - that is I'm looking at vertex =[0 1]= and I need to decide which direction to step to next. There are 4 directions and the way we can pick is
   1. Always try the same sequence (eg Right, Down, Left, Up). Take the first step you can
   2. Do not step back to where you have been
   3. Never step down a path where surrounded by two squares with the same mark

      If we were to follow that rule we would step

      - [0 1] -> [1 1]
      - [1 1] -> [2 1]
      - [2 1] -> [2 0]
      - [2 0] -> [3 0]
      - [3 0] -> [3 1]
      - [3 1] -> [4 1]
      - [4 1] -> [4 2]
      - [4 2] -> [4 3]
      - [4 3] -> [4 4]
      - [4 4] -> [3 4]
      - [3 4] -> [3 5]

      Etcetera. I think I've convinced myself that this would both work, and not require any sort of edge detection.


   Well lets implement this then

   First, how about figurg out the vertex we will start at

     (require threading)

                     (land land water water)))
     
     (ormap identity (for/sequence ([row board]
                                    [r (in-naturals)])
                       (for/first ([cell row]
                                   [c (in-naturals)]

   How to implement ~segment-on-perimeter?~ given two vericies. Well firstly, if either of the verticies is out of bounds the answer is "no". Otherwise we have that rule where the cells on both sides of the line should be different. So how do we know which cells those are?

   ~#[1 1]~ to ~#[1 2]~ should give us cells ~#[0 1]~ and ~#[1 1]~. If the move is to the right therefore the cells to worry about it are ~(+ vertex-from #[-1 0])~ and ~(+ vertex-to #[0 -1])~
      
   What about the other direction?

   ~#[1 2]~ to ~#[1 1]~ should again give us cells ~#[0 1]~ and ~#[1 1]~. So if the move is to the left then the cells to worry about are ~(+ vertex-from #[0 -1])~ and ~(+ vertex-to #[-1 0])~
      
   | direction | vertex-from | vertex-to | diff | adjacent cells |

   | Right     | 1 1         | 1 2       | 0 1  | [0 1] [1 1]    |
   | Left      | 1 2         | 1 1       | 0 -1 | [0 1] [1 1]    |
   | Down      | 1 1         | 2 1       | 1 0  | [1 0] [1 1]    |

   - if left/right (diff 1) then it would be ~(min vertex-from vertex-to)~ and the one above it
   - if down/up (diff 0) then it would be ~(min ...)~ and the one to the left of it
